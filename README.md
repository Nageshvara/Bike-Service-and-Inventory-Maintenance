# Bike-Service-and-Inventory-Maintenance

This project was created as a part of our Design Thinking Course. The idea is to predict the two wheeler's service date based on various factors that directly affect the vehicle's performance. The inventory maintenance is to inform the users about the right quantity of stocks.
